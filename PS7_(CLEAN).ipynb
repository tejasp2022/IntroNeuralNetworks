        "Ok, now you are ready to create a complete, fully connected neural net with a hidden layer and non-linearities. You will use this network to solve the XOR problem, using the same training data as in Problem 2. Your network architecture should have the following components:\n",
        "- Two input units, with activations $x_1$ and $x_2$.  These are just the coordinates of 2D points.\n",
        "- A variable number of hidden units, H.  Write your code so that you can select the number of hidden units as a hyperparameter.  Let's call the activation of the $i$'th hidden unit, $a^1_i$.  Let's call the weights of these units $w^1_{ij}$.  This is the weight from input unit $j$ to hidden unit $i$.  \n",
        "- se a RELU non-linearity for the hidden units.  So to determine the activation of a hidden unit we have: $z^1_i = w^1_{i1}x_1 + w^1_{i2}x_2 + b^1_i$, and $a^1_i = max(0, z^1_i)$.\n",
        "- There is then a single output unit.  Call its activation $a^2$.  We compute this as: $z^2 = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^H w^2_{1i}a^1_i \\right) + b^2$, and $a^2 = \\sigma(z^2)$, where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid nonlinearity.  This last part is just the same as in Problem 2.  And, like Problem 2, you can train your network using the cross-entropy loss.\n",
